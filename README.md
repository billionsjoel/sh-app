## About Scribe House

We love books. We love books good books. We love words, and the different ways in which words can be published. Thatâ€™s why our mission is to help you publish your content well.

We offer publishing and promotional advice to firms and individuals across the continent. Publishing consultancies and editorial services are comfortably transacted online, making it easy for us to serve you wherever you are.
