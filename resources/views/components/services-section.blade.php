                            You have written. We have edited. You would like to produce your content in the best
                            possible format, and sell it. But
                            you don’t know how to. Scribe House will tell you how, and do it for you even, at an
                            affordable cost. We will link you
                            up with competent service providers at each step of production, overseeing the book
                            design and printing processes (or
                            digital book development). We can walk you through your publishing journey, right from
                            the time we receive your
                            manuscript, to the time it is positioned at strategic selling points.

                            The cry of many over the years has been ‘Africans have a poor reading culture.’ Putting
                            aside the arguments justifying
                            or defying this cry, we are firm believers that charity starts at home. What better way
                            to grow and encourage the
                            reading culture in this country and continent, than by starting with our children?
                            Scribe House promotes and publishes
                            literature for youths from 0-14yrs. We have partnered with TWOG Games, a company that
                            creates word games for toddlers
                            and ‘tweens’. The Junior Scribes programmes and TWOG games provide fun, interactive
                            ‘word-ertainment’ for children and
                            tweens.
